It outlines the components and concepts that are used in various metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. The classification adopted in this paper differentiates between single solution based metaheuristics and population based metaheuristics. The literature survey is accompanied by the presentation of references for further details, including applications. Recent trends are also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Braux1999,
	abstract = {Reflection plays a major role in the programming of generic applications. However, it introduces an interpretation layer which is detrimental to performance. A solution consists of relying on partial evaluation to remove this interpretation layer. This paper deals with improving a standard partial evaluator in order to handle the Java reflection API. The improvements basically consist of taking type information into account when distinguishing between static and dynamic data, as well as introducing two new specialization actions: reflection actions. Benchmarks using the serialization framework show the benefits of the approach.},

@article{Rocha2011,
	abstract = {Since 2004. Java provides support to general purpose annotations (also known as metadata) that allows developers to define their your own annotation types. However, seven years after their inception in the Java language, we still do not have empirical evidence on how software developers are effectively using annotations in their systems. Therefore, this paper presents an empirical study on how annotations are used on a corpus of 106 open-source Java systems. On total, we have evaluated more than 160,000 annotations that have been applied to the source code of such systems. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (a) the so-called annotation-hell phenomena affects many of the evaluated systems; (b) developers are using both pre-delined annotations and annotations delined by external frameworks, mostly annotations dedicated to persistence and testing; (c) most of the evaluated annotations have been employed to annotate methods (more than 90{\%}); (d) although Java does provide not support to annotations for anonymous classes, several programs from our corpus have applied annotations to such classes.},

@article{Romanycia1985,
	abstract = {From the mid-1950's to the present the notion of a heuristic has played a crucial role in the AI researchers' descriptions of their work. What has not been generally noticed is that different researchers have often applied the term to rather different aspects of their programs. Things that would be called a heuristic by one researcher would not be so called by others. This is because many heuristics embody a variety of different features, and the various researchers have emphasized different ones of these features as being essential to being a heuristic. This paper steps back from any particular research program and investigates the question of what things, historically, have been thought to be central to the notion of a heuristic and which ones conflict with others. After analyzing the previous definitions and examining current usage of the term, a synthesizing definition is provided. The hope is that with this broader account of â€˜heuristic' in hand, researchers can benefit more fully from the insights of others, even if those insights are couched in a somewhat alien vocabulary.},
