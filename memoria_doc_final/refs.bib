@article{Braux1999,
	abstract = {Reflection plays a major role in the programming of generic applications. However, it introduces an interpretation layer which is detrimental to performance. A solution consists of relying on partial evaluation to remove this interpretation layer. This paper deals with improving a standard partial evaluator in order to handle the Java reflection API. The improvements basically consist of taking type information into account when distinguishing between static and dynamic data, as well as introducing two new specialization actions: reflection actions. Benchmarks using the serialization framework show the benefits of the approach.},

@article{Rocha2011,
	abstract = {Since 2004. Java provides support to general purpose annotations (also known as metadata) that allows developers to define their your own annotation types. However, seven years after their inception in the Java language, we still do not have empirical evidence on how software developers are effectively using annotations in their systems. Therefore, this paper presents an empirical study on how annotations are used on a corpus of 106 open-source Java systems. On total, we have evaluated more than 160,000 annotations that have been applied to the source code of such systems. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (a) the so-called annotation-hell phenomena affects many of the evaluated systems; (b) developers are using both pre-delined annotations and annotations delined by external frameworks, mostly annotations dedicated to persistence and testing; (c) most of the evaluated annotations have been employed to annotate methods (more than 90{\%}); (d) although Java does provide not support to annotations for anonymous classes, several programs from our corpus have applied annotations to such classes.},

@article{Romanycia1985,
	abstract = {From the mid-1950's to the present the notion of a heuristic has played a crucial role in the AI researchers' descriptions of their work. What has not been generally noticed is that different researchers have often applied the term to rather different aspects of their programs. Things that would be called a heuristic by one researcher would not be so called by others. This is because many heuristics embody a variety of different features, and the various researchers have emphasized different ones of these features as being essential to being a heuristic. This paper steps back from any particular research program and investigates the question of what things, historically, have been thought to be central to the notion of a heuristic and which ones conflict with others. After analyzing the previous definitions and examining current usage of the term, a synthesizing definition is provided. The hope is that with this broader account of â€˜heuristic' in hand, researchers can benefit more fully from the insights of others, even if those insights are couched in a somewhat alien vocabulary.},

In particular, two broadly defined competing approaches, the traditional "waterfall" approach and iterative and incremental development (IID), are compared with regards to development cost and duration, and resulting product quality. The method used for this comparison is a systematic literature review. The small set of studies we located did not demonstrate any identifiable cost, duration, or quality trends, although there was some evidence suggesting the superiority of IID (in particular XP). The results of this review indicate that further empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, on this topic need to be undertaken. In order to effectively compare study results, the research community needs to reach a consensus on a set of comparable parameters that best assess cost, duration, and quality. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

This is due to the importance of combinatorial optimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world. We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I{\&}D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.},
